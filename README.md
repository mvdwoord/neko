Neko (also known by its less original name netconfig) is a network settings templating tool. It can read settings from DNS, discover the size of a network and set local network settings statically using discovered information.

Neko currently handles RHEL (4, 5 ,6) and SLES (9, 10, 11) based systems. Weâ€™re working on making Neko more flexible so it can support other platforms too!
